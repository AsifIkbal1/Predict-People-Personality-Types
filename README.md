# Predict People Personality Types

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict people's personality types based on a set of psychological and demographic features. The project is built using Python and involves exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and training of classification models to predict personality types.

## Project Overview

This project uses a dataset containing various features like:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Education Level**
- **Introversion Score**
- **Sensing Score**
- **Thinking Score**
- **Judging Score**
- **Interest Area**
  
The target variable is **Personality Type**, which is categorized into different types (e.g., ENFP, ESFP). The goal is to predict the correct personality type based on the input features.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook, `Predict People Personality Types.ipynb`, contains the following steps:
1. **Data Loading**: Reading and inspecting the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, transforming categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing feature relationships and distributions.
4. **Model Training**: Multiple machine learning models (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) are trained to classify the personality types.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search or random search to optimize model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains approximately 128,000 entries and 9 columns. It includes both numeric and categorical data.

| Feature            | Description                                          |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Age                | Age of the individual (numeric)                      |
| Gender             | Gender of the individual (categorical)               |
| Education          | Education level (numeric)                            |
| Introversion Score | Score for introversion (numeric)                     |
| Sensing Score      | Score for sensing traits (numeric)                   |
| Thinking Score     | Score for thinking ability (numeric)                 |
| Judging Score      | Score for judging ability (numeric)                  |
| Interest           | Individual's interest area (categorical)             |
| Personality        | Personality type (categorical - target variable)     |

## Machine Learning Models

The following models have been explored in the notebook:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are used:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/personality-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd personality-prediction
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Predict People Personality Types.ipynb
   ```

4. Run the notebook step-by-step to understand the data, train models, and make predictions.

## Results

The best-performing model is reported with its accuracy, precision, and recall scores. The trained model can predict the personality type of new individuals based on their provided features.

## Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
- Implementation of deep learning models.
- Adding more features for personality prediction.
